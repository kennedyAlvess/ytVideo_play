# YouTube Video Player

This project aims to recreate the YouTube video play screen using React. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface that closely resembles the familiar YouTube video player, allowing users to watch videos, control playback, and interact with video-related features.

## Features

- Video playback: Users can watch videos with all the standard playback controls, including play, pause, seek, and volume control.
- Video information: The video player displays relevant information about the video.
- Related videos: The player suggests related videos based on the current video being watched, allowing users to easily discover new content.
- Full-screen mode: Users can toggle between a regular view and full-screen mode for an immersive video-watching experience.
